This project was created for an INSAID capstone project to help HR Advisories to detect possible employees who might quit the organization. The data was sourced from the HRMS where the details of all past and current employees was being recorded for the last 15 years.

In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge whether the employee is likely to quit or not.
